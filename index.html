                <p>The Great Kohli a.k.a. King Kohli
                    In 2019, Virat Kohli was awarded the coveted Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for the second year in a
                    row,
                    also named as the ICC ODI and Test Cricketer of 2018. He became the first cricketer to do so in the
                    same
                    calendar year.

                    The 33-year-old, has returned to form with this dominating performance in the initial game of the
                    T20
                    World Cup. Without a doubt, King Kohli also enjoyed a great phase of his career as both captain and
                    batsman over the years. His dominance with the willow has always been a topic of discussion among
                    the
                    cricket fraternity while his game reached new levels.

                    At that time, Twitter introduced the latest GOAT icon on its official handle and the ICC took the
                    opportunity to add more fuel to the debate by asking the cricket fraternity and fans whether Kohli
                    has
                    called himself the ‘Greatest of All Time’ (GOAT) has been established.

                    Former England captain Michael Vaughan, who is a vocal figure on Twitter, referred to Kohli as the
                    ‘GOAT’ (Greatest of All Time). When a user asked in the comments as to whether Vaughan was
                    indicating
                    that Kohli was better than the likes of Australian legend Sir Don Bradman, West Indies great Brian
                    Lara
                    and Tendulkar, Vaughan replied, “In One day cricket … YES …”</p>

                <p>Virat Kohli, who turned 34 on Saturday is one of the finest players ever to play for India. But is he
                    the GOAT = Greatest Of All Time - of cricket?

                    Kohli himself answered that question in a fun chat on #CricketLIVE, in which he replied to some of
                    the most asked questioned about him.

                    Is Virat Kohli the GOAT of cricket? That was the first question in a tweet by broadcaster Star
                    Sports.</p>
